Project Description --- A learning platform based on space data in which users can select specific topics to explore. The home page will display
                        space and georgraphical data based on the user's location and allow them the opportunity to take a space quiz on a seperate
                        page, in which they will be added to the database of users who have completed the quiz as well.
